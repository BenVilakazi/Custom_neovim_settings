## Custom Vim Settings

This repository contains my custom Vim settings. It is a work in progress, and I am constantly adding new features and improvements.

### Installation

To install these settings, clone the repository to your local machine and copy the   .vimrc   file to your home directory. You may need to create the   .vimrc   file if it does not already exist.

### Usage

Once you have installed the settings, you can start using them by opening Vim and typing   :source ~/.vimrc  . This will load the settings into Vim.

### Features

The following are some of the features that are included in these settings:

* Syntax highlighting for a variety of programming languages
* Autocompletion for commands and functions
* Code folding
* Indentation guides
* Line numbers
* Multiple cursors
* Visual selection
* Search and replace
* And more!

### Customization

These settings are highly customizable. You can change the colors, fonts, and other settings to suit your own preferences. To learn more about customizing Vim, I recommend reading the [Vim documentation] (https://www.vim.org/docs.html).

### Contributing

If you would like to contribute to this repository, please feel free to submit a pull request. I am always looking for new features and improvements.
